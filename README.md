Home Assistant integration for monitoring your Bitcoin miners on a self-hosted [Public Pool](https://github.com/benjamin-wilson/public-pool) instance.

Tested with the [Start9 Public Pool package](https://marketplace.start9.com/). Should work with any self-hosted Public Pool instance.

## Features

### Pool-Level Sensors
- **Pool Hashrate** - Total hashrate of the entire pool (TH/s)
- **Pool Miners** - Number of active miners on the pool
- **Pool Block Height** - Current Bitcoin block height tracked by the pool

### Network-Level Sensors
- **Network Difficulty** - Current Bitcoin network difficulty
- **Network Hashrate** - Total Bitcoin network hashrate (EH/s)
- **Network Block Height** - Current Bitcoin blockchain height

### Address-Level Sensors
- **Best Difficulty** - Highest difficulty share submitted by your miners
- **Workers Count** - Number of your active mining workers
- **Total Hashrate** - Combined hashrate of all your workers (GH/s)

### Worker Sensors (Per Miner)
For each of your mining workers, the integration creates:
- **Hashrate** - Individual worker hashrate (GH/s)
- **Best Difficulty** - Best share submitted by this worker
- **Last Seen** - Timestamp of last activity from this worker
